# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the Weather analysis for W. Avy.
The project that we are working on for W. Avy is using Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to determine temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, we want to look at the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. We will use this data to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable all year. 

## Results
- First, we can see below the summary for the month of June.

This shows that the average tempature during the month of June is 75 degrees. But can range from 64 degrees to around 85 at any point. 
- Secondly, below we can see the summary for the month of December.

This will show you that the average tempture during the month of December is around 71 degrees. It will range from 56 degrees up to 83 degrees. 

- Lastly, we want to see a vistual representation of the tempature during these two months.

## Summary
Overall, we can see that when we look at the data over the months of June and December, there is a large overlap of tempatures. While there seems to be a bit more of a varity that the tempature can be during the month of December, we would still suggest that it would be sustainable to keep the shop open during the winter months.
